abstract: |
    This paper presents a novel and formal interpretation of the original vision
    of hypertext: infrastructure-agnostic hypertext is independent from
    specific standards such as data formats and network protocols. Its model is
    illustrated with examples and references to existing technologies that allow
    for implementation and integration in current information infrastructures such
    as the Internet.
