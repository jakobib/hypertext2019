<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The original vision of hypertext as proposed by Ted Nelson <span class="citation" data-cites="Q4004427 Q62018774">(Nelson 1965; Nelson, Smith, and Mallicoat 2007)</span> still waits to be realized. His influence is visible through people who, influenced by his works, shaped the computer world of today, last but not least the Web <span class="citation" data-cites="Q5529815">(Nelson 2008)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Nelson’s core idea, a network of visibly connected documents called Xanadu, goes beyond the Web in several aspects. In particular it promises non-breaking links and it uses links to build documents (with versions, quotations, overlay markup…) instead of using documents to build links <span class="citation" data-cites="Q63197724">(Nelson 1997)</span>. The concept of hypertext or more general ‘hypermedia’ has also been used differently from Nelson, both in the literary community (that focused on simple links), and in the hypertext research community (that focused on tools) <span class="citation" data-cites="Q62056726">(Wardrip-Fruin 2004)</span>.</p>
<p>This paper tries to get back to the original vision of hypertext by specification of a formal model that puts transcludeable documents at its heart. Apart from Nelson’s works <span class="citation" data-cites="Q4004427 Q62071588 Q5157448 Q15975218 Q55888092 Q62018774">(Nelson 1965; Nelson 1967; Nelson 1974; Nelson 1980; Nelson 1999; Nelson, Smith, and Mallicoat 2007)</span> this paper draws from research on data format analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="Q22910779 Q62475820">(Voss 2013a; Kent 1988)</span>, content-based identifiers <span class="citation" data-cites="Q63233029 Q61974405">(Trask 2016; Lukka and Fallenstein 2002)</span>, existing transclusion technologies for the Web <span class="citation" data-cites="Q62071521 Q62087940 Q62087795 Q62820096">(Akscyn 2015; Tennison 2012; Appleby et al. 2017; Csillag 2013)</span> and hypertext systems beyond link-based models <span class="citation" data-cites="Q62123282">(Atzenbeck et al. 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Limited by the state of document processing tools and by submission guidelines, this paper is not a demo of hypertext.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> On a closer look however there are traces of transclusion links that have been processed to this paper.

<h2>Outline</h2>
<p>The architecture of an infrastructure-agnostic hypertext system consists of four basic elements and their relations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>documents</strong> include all finite, digital objects</p></li>
<li><p><strong>document identifiers</strong> reference individual documents</p></li>
<li><p><strong>content locators</strong> reference segments within documents</p></li>
<li><p><strong>edit list</strong> combine parts of existing document into new ones</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Instances of each element can further be grouped by <strong>data formats</strong>. The elements and their relations are each described in the following sections after a formal definition.</p>
<section id="formal-model" class="level3">
<h3>Formal model</h3>
<p>A hypertext system is a tuple <span class="math inline">⟨<em>D</em>, <em>I</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>E</em>, <em>S</em>, <em>R</em>, <em>U</em>, <em>T</em>, <em>A</em>⟩</span> where:</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="math inline"><em>D</em></span></dt>
<dd>is a set of documents
</dd>
<dt><span class="math inline"><em>I</em></span></dt>
<dd>is a set of document identifiers with <span class="math inline"><em>I</em> ⊂ <em>D</em></span>
</dd>
<dt><span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span></dt>
<dd>is a set of content locators with <span class="math inline"><em>C</em> ⊂ <em>D</em></span>
</dd>
<dt><span class="math inline"><em>E</em></span></dt>
<dd>is a set of edit lists with <span class="math inline"><em>E</em> ⊂ <em>D</em></span>
</dd>
<dt><span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span></dt>
<dd>is a set of document segments with <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> ⊂ <em>C</em> × <em>D</em></span>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Document sets can each be grouped into (possibly overlapping) data formats. The hypertext system further consists of:</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span></dt>
<dd>is a retrieval function with <span class="math inline"><em>R</em>: <em>I</em> → <em>D</em></span>
</dd>
<dt><span class="math inline"><em>U</em></span></dt>
<dd>is a segments usage function <span class="math inline"><em>U</em>: <em>E</em> → 𝒫(<em>S</em>)</span>
</dd>
<dt><span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span></dt>
<dd>is a transclusion function with <span class="math inline"><em>T</em>: <em>S</em> → <em>D</em></span>
</dd>
<dt><span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span></dt>
<dd>is an hypertext assemble function with <span class="math inline"><em>A</em>: <em>E</em> → <em>D</em></span>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A practical hypertext system needs executable implementations of the functions <span class="math inline"><em>R</em>, <em>U</em>, <em>T</em>, <em>A</em></span> and a method to tell whether a given combination <span class="math inline">⟨<em>c</em>, <em>d</em>⟩ ∈ <em>C</em> × <em>D</em></span> is part of <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> to allow its use with <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="documents" class="level3">
<h3>Documents</h3>
<p>A document is a finite sequence of bytes. This definition roughly equates with the definition of data as documents <span class="citation" data-cites="Q61793433 Q61967951">(Furner 2016; Voss 2013b)</span>. The notion of hypertext used in this paper therefore subsumes all kinds of hyperdata (datasets that transclude other datasets). Documents are static by content <span class="citation" data-cites="Q62575936">(Renear, Dubin, and Wickett 2009)</span> but they may be processed dynamically. Documents are grouped by non-disjoint data formats such as UTF-8, CSV, SVG, PDF and many many more.</p>
</section>
<section id="document-identifiers" class="level3">
<h3>Document identifiers</h3>
<p>A document identifier is a relatively short document that refers to another document. Identifiers have properties depending on the particular identifier system they belong to <span class="citation" data-cites="Q61967951">(Voss 2013b, 59–71)</span>. Identifiers in infrastructure-agnostic hypertext must first be <em>unambiguous</em> (an identifier must reference only one document), <em>persistent</em> (the reference must not change over time), and <em>actionable</em> (hypertext systems should provide methods to retrieve documents via the retrieval function <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span>). Properties that should be fulfilled at least to some degree include <em>uniqueness</em> (a document should not be referenced by too many identifiers), <em>performance</em> (identifiers should be easy to compute and to validate), and <em>distributedness</em> (identifiers should not require a central institution). The actual choice of an identifier system depends on weighting of specific requirements. A promising choice is the application of content-based identifiers as proposed at least once in the context of hypertext systems <span class="citation" data-cites="Q61974405">(Lukka and Fallenstein 2002)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="content-locators" class="level3">
<h3>Content locators</h3>
<p>A content locator is a document that can be used to select parts of another document via transclusion. Nelsons refers to these locators as “reference pointers” <span class="citation" data-cites="Q55888092">(Nelson 1999)</span>, exemplified with spans of bytes or characters in a document. Content locators depend on data formats and document models. For instance locator languages XPath, XPointer, and XQuery act on XML documents, which can be serialized in different forms (therefore it makes no sense to locate parts of an XML document with positions of bytes). Other locator languages apply to tabular data (SQL, RFC 7111), to graphs (SPARQL, GraphQL), or to two-dimensional images (IIIF), to name a few. Whether and how parts of a document can be selected with a content locator language depends on which data format the document is interpreted in. For instance an SVG image file can be processed at least as image, as XML document, or as Unicode string, each with its own methods of locating document segments. Content locators can be extended to all executable programs that reproducibly process some documents into other documents. This generalization can be useful to track data processing pipelines as hyperdata such as discussed for executable papers and reproducible research. Restriction of content locators to less powerful query languages might make sense from a security point of view.</p>
</section>
<section id="edit-lists" class="level3">
<h3>Edit Lists</h3>
<p>An edit list is a document that describes how to construct a new document from parts of other documents. Edit lists are known as <em>Edit Decision Lists</em> in Xanadu and the idea was borrowed from film making <span class="citation" data-cites="Q62071588">(Nelson 1967)</span>. Simplified forms of edit lists are implemented in version control systems and in collaborative tools such as wikis and real-time editing. Hypertext edit lists go beyond this one-dimensional case by support of multiple source documents and by more flexible methods of document processing in addition to basic operations such as insert, delete, and replace. The actual processing steps tracked by an edit list depend on data formats of transcluded documents. Just like content locators, edit lists could be extended to arbitrary executable programs that implement the hypertext assemble function <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> for some subset of edit lists. To ensure reproducibility and reliable transclusion,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> these programs must not access unstable external information such as documents that may change <span class="citation" data-cites="Q62575936">(Renear, Dubin, and Wickett 2009)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-formats" class="level3">
<h3>Data formats</h3>
<p>An often neglected fundamental property of digital documents is their grounding in data formats. A data format is a set of documents that share a common data model, also known as their document model, and a common serialization (see fig. ). Models define elements of a document in terms of sets, strings, tuples, graphs or similar structures. These structures are mathematically rigorous in theory <span class="citation" data-cites="Q62575936">(Renear, Dubin, and Wickett 2009)</span> but more based on descriptive patterns in practice <span class="citation" data-cites="Q22910779">(Voss 2013a)</span>. The meaning of these elements (for instance “words”, “sentences”, and “paragraphs” in a document model) is based on ideas that we at least assume to be consistent among different people.</p>
<figure>
<img src="levels-of-data-modeling.svg" width="60%"/>
<figcaption>levels of data modeling</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Data modeling, the act of mapping between ideas, models, and formats is an unsolved problem because ideas can be expressed in many models and models can be interpreted in many ways <span class="citation" data-cites="Q62475820">(Kent 1988)</span>. Data models can further be expressed in multiple formats although these formats should fully be convertible between each other, at least in theory.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Formats can further be serialized in multiple forms, which for their part are based on other data models. For instance the RDF model can be serialized in RDF/XML format which is based on the XML model. XML can be serialized XML syntax which is based on the Unicode model, and Unicode can be serialized in UTF-8. At the end of these chains of abstraction eventually all documents can be serialized as sequence of bytes. Serializations are seldom simple mappings as most serialization formats allow insignificant variances such as additional whitespace. To check whether a data object conforms to a serialization, formats are often described with a formal grammar that can also give insights about the format’s model.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Infrastructure-agnostic hypertext does not impose any limits on possible data formats and their models.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following example may illustrate the formal model and its elements. Let <span class="math inline">⟨<em>D</em>, <em>I</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>E</em>, <em>S</em>, <em>R</em>, <em>U</em>, <em>T</em>, <em>A</em>⟩</span> be a hypertext system with <span class="math inline"><em>D</em></span> the set of printable ASCII character strings and some documents:</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="math inline"><em>d</em><sub>1</sub></span></dt>
<dd>= ‘<code>My name is Alice</code>’
</dd>
<dt><span class="math inline"><em>d</em><sub>2</sub></span></dt>
<dd>= ‘<code>Alice</code>’
</dd>
<dt><span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub>1</sub></span></dt>
<dd>= ‘<code>char=11,15</code>’
</dd>
<dt><span class="math inline"><em>d</em><sub>3</sub></span></dt>
<dd>= ‘<code>Hello, !</code>’
</dd>
<dt><span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub>2</sub></span></dt>
<dd>= ‘<code>char=7</code>’
</dd>
<dt><span class="math inline"><em>d</em><sub>4</sub></span></dt>
<dd>= ‘<code>Hello, Alice!</code>’
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If <span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub>2</sub></span> are read in content locator syntax as defined by RFC 5147 so that <span class="math inline"><em>T</em>(⟨<em>c</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>d</em><sub>1</sub>⟩) = <em>d</em><sub>2</sub></span> then <span class="math inline"><em>d</em><sub>4</sub></span> can be constructed by transcluding a document segment of <span class="math inline"><em>d</em><sub>1</sub></span> into <span class="math inline"><em>d</em><sub>3</sub></span> at position <span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub>2</sub></span>. The corresponding edit list <span class="math inline"><em>e</em><sub>1</sub> ∈ <em>E</em></span> with <span class="math inline"><em>A</em>(<em>e</em><sub>1</sub>) = <em>d</em><sub>4</sub></span> could look like this:</p>
<pre><code> take      995f37f2e066b7d8893873ca4d780da5bf017184

<h2>Implementations</h2>
<!--The infrastructure-agnostic model of hypertext helps to analyze hypertext systems
but its ultimate goal is guidance to actual xanalogical implementations. -->
<p>One of the problems faced by project Xanadu was it long required new developments such as computer networks, document processing, and graphical user interfaces ahead of their time. Today we can build on a many existing technologies:</p>
<dl>
<dt>networks:</dt>
<dd>storage and communication networks are ubiquitous with several protocols (HTTP, IPFS, BitTorrent…).
</dd>
<dt>identifier systems:</dt>
<dd>document identifiers should be part of the URI/IRI identifier system. More specific candidates of relevant identifier systems include URLs and content-based identifiers.
</dd>
<dt>formats:</dt>
<dd>hypertext systems should not be limited to their own document formats (such as the Web’s focus on HTML/DOM) but allow for integration of all kinds of digital objects.

<p>Access to documents via a retrieval function <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> can be implemented with existing network and identifier technologies.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Despite the availability of technologies to build on, creation of a xanalogical hypertext system is challenging for several reasons. The general problems involved with transclusion have been identified <span class="citation" data-cites="Q62071521">(Akscyn 2015)</span>. Other or more specific challenges include (ordered by severity):</p>
<dl>
<dt>storage:</dt>
<dd>data storage is cheap, but someone has to pay for it.
</dd>
<dt>normalization:</dt>
<dd>most documents (including identifiers) can be serialized in different forms. To support unique document identifiers, a hypertext system should support normalization of documents to canonical forms.
</dd>
<dt>link services:</dt>
<dd>databases of links have been proposed as central part of Open Hypermedia Systems <span class="citation" data-cites="Q62123282">(Atzenbeck et al. 2017)</span> but they are not available for the Web because of commercial interest.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Links are ideally derived from edit lists with segments usage function <span class="math inline"><em>U</em></span>. Recent development such as Webmention and OpenCitation may help to improve collection of links.
</dd>
<dt>visualization and navigation:</dt>
<dd>this most recognizable element of hypertext has mostly been reduced to simple links while Nelson’s ideas seem to have been forgotten or ignored <span class="citation" data-cites="Q62847600">(Viégas, Wattenberg, and Dave, n.d.)</span>. Nevertheless the creation of tools for visualization and navigation in hypertext structures is less challenging then getting hold of the underlying documents and hyperlinks.
</dd>
<dt>edit list formats</dt>
<dd>despite edit lists being the very core of the idea of hypertext <span class="citation" data-cites="Q62071588">(Nelson 1967)</span>, they have rarely been implemented in reusable data formats. Proper hypertext implementations therefore require to establish new formats with support of hypertext assemble function <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and segments usage function <span class="math inline"><em>U</em></span>.
</dd>
<dt>editing tools</dt>
<dd>applications to create and modify digital objects track changes don’t provide this information in form of reusable edit lists, if at all. Hypermedia authoring needs to be integrated into existing editing tools to succed <span class="citation" data-cites="Q61637727">(Di Iorio and Vitali 2005)</span>.
</dd>
<dt>copyright and control:</dt>
<dd>who should be allowed to use which documents under which conditions? The answers primarily depend on legal, social, and political requirements.

<h3>Differences to Xanadu</h3>
<p>Project Xanadu promised a comprehensive hypertext system including elements for content (xanadocs), network (servers), rights (micropayment), and interfaces (viewers) – years before each these concept made it into the computer mainstream. Today a xanalogical hypertext system can more build on existing technologies. The infrastructure-agnostic model of hypertext tries to capture the core parts of the original vision of hypertext by concentrating on its documents and document formats. For this reason some requirements listed by Xanadu Australia <span class="citation" data-cites="Q62213482">(Pam 2002)</span> or mentioned by Nelson in other publications are not incorporated explicitly:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>identified servers as canonical sources of documents</li>
<li>identified users and access control</li>
<li>copyright and royalty system via micropayment</li>
<li>user interfaces to navigate and edit hypertexts</li>
</ol>
<p>Meeting these requirements in actual implementations is possible nevertheless. Identified servers (a) and users (b) were part of <em>Tumbler</em> identifers (that combined document identifiers and content locators) <span class="citation" data-cites="Q15975218">(Nelson 1980)</span> but the current OpenXanadu implementation uses plain URLs as part of its <em>Xanadoc</em> edit list format <span class="citation" data-cites="Q63079762">(Nelson and Levin 2014)</span>. Canonical sources of documents (a) could also be implemented by blockchains or alternative technology to prove that a specific document existed on a specific server at a specific time. Such knowledge of a document’s first insertion into the hypertext system would also allow for royalty systems (c).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Identification of users and access control (b) could also be implemented in several ways but this feature much more depends on network infrastructures and socio-technical environments, including rules of privacy, intellectual property, and censorship. Last but not least, a hypertext system needs applications to visualize, navigate, and edit hypermedia (d)<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Several user interface have been invented in the history of hypertext <span class="citation" data-cites="Q63093195">(Müller-Prove 2002)</span> and there will unlikely be one final application because user interfaces depend on use-cases and file formats.</p>

<h2>Summary and conclusion</h2>
<p>This paper presents a novel interpretation of the original vision of hypertext <span class="citation" data-cites="Q4004427 Q62071588">(Nelson 1965; Nelson 1967)</span>. Its infrastructure-agnostic model does not require or exclude specific data formats or network protocols. Abstract from these ever-changing technologies, the focus is on hypermedia <em>content</em> (documents) and <em>connections</em> (hyperlinks). Core elements of hypertext systems are identified as documents, document identifiers, content locators, and edit lists. A formal model defines their relations based on knowledge of data formats and models. It is shown which technologies can be used to implement such a hypertext system integrated into current information infrastructures (especially the Internet and the Web) and which challenges still exist (in particular support of edit lists in editing tools).</p>
<!--
Ironically Berners-Lee seems to have aimed at a more Xanalogic
hypertext system but he found standardization of hypertext too
much focused on "the format for exchangeable media"
document formats than on protocols so he created HTTP. [@BernersLee1990]

          <p>The author proposes and briefly describes a post-Xanadu hypertext model (as a high-level formalism) to run on any network infrastructure. The author re-introduces Ted Nelson’s idea of transclusion as the main mode of linking (as opposed to the current html notion of embedded span-to-doc links), and brings it forward into the current networked environment (e.g. → the distributed web). The author provides a high level definition of the basic elements of the model, and identifies a handful of challenges (some of which might represent a career’s worth of research like ownership and control, hypertext visualization, user interfaces).</p>
          <p>It’s great to see someone take Ted Nelson’s ideas and run with them, especially to examine which are practical in the current setting, and which are not. Yet I came away from the paper unsure about its contribution (in other words, the author claims novelty of vision, but I’m not quite sure where the novelty lies). It might be best for the author to focus on what they feel is the most important contribution of the work, and to go deeper on what is specifically new, and—most importantly—justify it with use (in other words, what aspects of current stakeholder behavior motive this formalism). That’s the problem with models: it’s fun to noodle around, and come up with more expressive notions of hypertext. It’s also easy to say, ‘we can slap a UI on it, implement the right services around it, and it’ll take off like a rocket.’ What will drive this change?</p>
          <p>Before the Web dominated the hypertext field, there were a number of different models that contributed to OHS specs. Particularly, there were a number of different views on how links should work: how they should be represented and stored (multi-headed links, links as relations, links as full-fledged objects on par with documents, computed links, etc.), how links should fail gracefully, how ownership should figure in, and so on. How something <em>should</em> work can be a dangerous way of talking about systems in the absence of constraints derived from practice. E.g., one look at copyright, and you’ll see a place where practice and law have gone asunder; technology, by itself, probably won’t be able to span the growing chasm. That’s why so many communities insist on some form of study, evaluation, simulation, or careful analysis.</p>
          But—I’ll ease up!—this is a short paper. I don’t see intrinsic harm in proposing new models in abbreviated form; I’m just not sure where to look for the novelty here. Perhaps the author could offer a tighter focus, and justify parts of the model with observed phenomenon.

          <p>The paper purports to present a novel and formal interpretation of Nelson’s view of hypertext. There are several reasonable ideas here. That said, I feel the paper tries to do too much, and consequently doesn’t treat any of its subjects to more than a cursory examination.</p>
          <p>The paper begins with a formal model of a hypertext system. In general, I often find formal models to be unmotivated. There are oodles of existing models for hypertext systems already – how does this further the field? What was either unexpressable or only awkwardly expressable previously that now has an elegant representation? Furthermore, I think the converse is quite clear: the model presented is static. A document as byte stream is wholly incompatible with the bulk of OHS work in which most elements were (at least in theory) computable. (This implies that a document is a function f that maps some input and some world state [e.g., current time] to some output.)</p>
          <p>The section on data formats was puzzling. Isn’t the whole point that we don’t care about data formats? I don’t see what this section contributes to the paper, other than the straightforward observation that the model “does not impose any limits on possible data formats”. This statement seems sufficient on its own.</p>
          I feel like there are some nice ideas here, and I realize this is a short paper, but the paper as currently constructed doesn’t seem to make any compelling point well. My recommendation is that you focus on one aspect (perhaps the model) and really explore this. How does this compare to Dexter, or Groenbaek &amp; Trigg’s ’96 work? What does the model do for us? As it stands, the model feels insufficient for dynamic data and structure, and is essentially a restatement of Dexter.

          <p>This paper presents an agnostic infrastructure model for hypertext and uses the Xanadu model/system and its capabilities as a reference for discussion.</p>
          It would be interesting for the paper to discuss (even if only briefly) how the proposed formal interpretation/model compares to other models that have been proposed for hypertext/hypermedia.

          <p>Thanks for the reviews. I tried to squeeze the whole idea into a short paper of two pages (PDF version) which turned out to be too dense. The reviews point out that “the paper tries to do too much” and the authors should “focus on what they feel is the most important contribution of the work”. Ironically a similar lack of focus, partly caused by the extend of his vision, can also found in Ted Nelson’s works. Anyway my paper needs to be extended:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>The model should be compared with existing hypertext models, in particular the Dexter Hypertext Reference Model (there is another irony in the timing of creation of this model and creation of the WWW, but that’s another story).</p></li>
          <li><p>The novelty of the vision of infrastructure agnostic hypertext must be presented more convincingly. The model alone is of little interest indeed, it must be justified with benefits compared to existing hypertext system. Nelson tried decades to argue for transclusion and non-breaking links.</p></li>
          <li><p>The role of data formats needs to be explained more clearly. Data formats are crucial to understand documents and we don’t want to limit hypertext to a specific hypertext document format. All kinds of data should be transcludeable persistently instead.</p></li>
          <li>The examples need to be presented in more detail. The edit list introduces hashes as document identifiers too early, better separate description of edit lists and (content-based) document identifiers. The paper might get more focus by explicitly choosing content-based identifiers as best approach.</li>
